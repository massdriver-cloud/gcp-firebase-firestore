_Brief description of bundle from an operator's point of view_

## Use Cases

_Common use cases for this bundle_

### Guided Configs

## Design

### How It Works

_Describe how it works_
+ Creates a Firebase project (connects to a GCP project)
+ Creates a Firestore database
+ Makes an artifact authentication that has the `firebase-config.json` inside of it

#### Best Practices

+ We only support two _locations_ for Firestore.
  + Both _locations_ are multi-region
  + US     => us-central  => nam5
  + Europe => europe-west => eur3
+ This means that if a region in GCP goes down, NO data will be lost
+ Firebase manages this regional (not zonal) failover for you

#### Security

#### Auditing

#### Compliance

#### Observability

### Trade-offs

+ Only one per GCP project can be used
  + Firestore is one per GCP project
+ Realtime database is not supported
+ Datastore mode is not supported

### Permissions

_list IAM permissions required on this bundle._
